# Calibration works as follows:
#
#   - A json file contains { 'calibrate': [ {'reading': HALL_READING, 'diameter': IN_MM}, ... ]}
#   - Calibration is read in from this file
#   - A certain M-code on the host (M407 D<width>) triggers a sample reading, which
#     adds the Hall reading and the diameter to the 'calibrate' key
#   - A certain M-code (M407 D<width> S<reading>) provides a diameter and reading
#   - Upon loading or updating the calibration info, a quadratic polynomial is fit to the
#     data
