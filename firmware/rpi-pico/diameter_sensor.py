# Firmware for hall-sensor based filament diameter sensors.
# Reads analog value from the sensor and provides a mapped and filtered diameter
# reading over I2C or UART
# Runs on Raspberry Pi Pico ($4)
# Licensed MIT by John Moser
#
# Threads and power usage:
#  - Main loop:  block on i2c
#  - LED:  sleep_ms() or block on q.get()
#  - sensor:  sleep_us(1); might be able to reduce this to event-driven
#
# Communications have the following aspects:
#  - Numbers are unsigned fixed-point 24-bit, using 10 bits for the
#    fraction.  This gives 1/1024, which can be rounded to represent three
#    decimal places.  The range is 0 to 16383.(1023/1024)
#  - Communications over UART are Reed-Solomon coded.
#
# Note the ADC is noisy and has a resolution of about 7.85 bits[1] in the
# initial RPi Pico release.  All readings from the ADC are MSB-aligned:
# padding to 14 bits is added as the least-significant bits of the reading.
# There is no practical difference between 14/10 fixed-point and a 24-bit
# integer for the calculations here, so a special case is not made.

# Calibration works as follows:
#
#   - A json file contains { 'calibrate': [ {'reading': HALL_READING, 'diameter': IN_MM}, ... ]}
#   - Calibration is read in from this file
#   - A certain M-code on the host (M407 D<width>) triggers a sample reading, which
#     adds the Hall reading and the diameter to the 'calibrate' key
#   - A certain M-code (M407 D<width> S<reading>) provides a diameter and reading
#   - Upon loading or updating the calibration info, a quadratic polynomial is fit to the
#     data

    # Because the Hall Effect sensor reading decreases with greater distance,
    # the smaller value of regression.roots() is the maximum distance sensed,
    # and all values sought are X being less than this.
    #
    # However, if the sensor never reads 0, then it will be everything to the
    # left of the vertex.  This is likely the better approach; it's just
    # setting the upper bound for diameter.
